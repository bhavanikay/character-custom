* Install Unity
* Open the server project file and connect the server to any port and your IP address. Make sure the server is running successfully.
* Open the client project file and connect to the same port as the server. 
* Once connected, enter the name for the user and select the join button. Once joined, the player will spawn with the specified username.
* To uninstall, delete the project files from your computer.

Closing thoughts:
Although our game is very simple in nature, we have created a strong foundation to build upon. This was a learning experience for all team members involved and although we encountered issues along the way we referred to documentation and other resources in order to reach solutions.
